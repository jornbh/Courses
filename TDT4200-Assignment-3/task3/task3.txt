All comparisons are form the mandelNav.sh-file when moving the initial image with the initial step vaules

When trying to paralelize the loop with the reutrn statement, the compiler started complaining, since openMP does not allow early termination from loops


1) Adding #pragma omp parallel
    Initial rendering time of the full image: ~0.4 seconds
    Rendering time when using openMP on the small loops: ~0.9 seconds

    Removing pragma from the inner loops:
        => Running time ~0.54 seconds

    Checking the pragmas by trying to remove them and checking the difference 
        Most of them did not do much of a difference, but removing the one in fillBlock() bot the speed back to the old level



    This implies that there is too much overhead compared to the work that is done 
        => We need to find a larger loop to use openMP in
            The "main" loop form task 1 and 2 seems like a good choice


2) Adding static parelelism to the recursive branching

Adding pragma to meraniSilver caused the time to go from 
    ~0.43 -> ~0.56 seconds
        => It became slower
        This might be because of overhead above a small loop that is run a lot of times, 
        or it might also be because of unbalanced load. 
    This is probably due to the fact that the size of the parallelized workload can vary quite a bit
    Therefore, some of the processes might risk standing idle for quite some time


3) Adding dtnamic paralelism to the recursive branching


We try to add #pragma omp for schedule(dynamic,1)
    We do this because the program operates in a tree-structure, with variable work, so there will be variable execution time
    Asking for load balance might alleviate this problem
        The runtime went from 
            ~0.43->~0.29 seconds
            => Noticeable improvement
                Now most of the program is paralelized. The only thing we can do is increase the granularity

Adding the dynamic threading in the branching casued a significant speedup
    Finding the relations between all the possible pragmas is somewhat more difficult
