The process of burning MSW\footnote{Manucipial Solid Waste} is a rather complex one, with multiple objectives, non-minimum phase responses long time-constants in combination with very short ones, large disturbances because of varying waste quality. During the last years, stricter regulations have been put in with the regards to the release of hazardous materials. As a result, SINTEF Energy Research has done further research on the subject of modelling and controlling combustion processes. This project attempts to use the additional information that is gained from having a sensor estimating the heating value of the waste, as well as some of the additional information gained from using a more complex model when controlling the plant.
