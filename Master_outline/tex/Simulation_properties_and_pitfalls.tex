\section{Simulation properties and pitfalls}

Simulating a Manicupial Solid Waste Combustion plant can be somewhat challenging because the dynamics of the system are quite stiff. This is because the fast dynamics need a short sampling-time if one is to be sure that they are accurate, while the slow dynamics need a long time-horizon if they are to converge. The result is simulations that can very easily take a lot of time. Fortunately, there are solvers for dynamical systems that are made for solving these kinds of problems.
