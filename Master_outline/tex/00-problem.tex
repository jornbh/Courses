\todo[inline]{Here the problem description  is presented.}
Combustion of municipal  waste comes with the issues of great uncertainty when it comes to the properties of the waste. Noxious gases are released if the combustion is incomplete. As a result, there are strict regulations the maximum concentration of $CO$, acidic gases, like $NO_x$, $HCl$ and $HF$ and heavy metals, like $Cd$ and $Hg$. Since the properties of the waste are inhomogeneous, it becomes difficult to maintain constant steam production
