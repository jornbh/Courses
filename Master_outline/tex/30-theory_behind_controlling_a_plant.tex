% \chapter{Theory}

% There are several ways to control a process, depending on its properties. Some of them require a model of the process to be known, others require the system to behave close to linearly within the region of operation. Depending on the method chosen, the sensitivity to noise, disturbances and modelling errors may also vary quite a lot. The waste incineration plant is a process containing unmeasured disturbances due to the varying composition of the waste, as well as the complex dynamics involved in combustion and the movement of fluids. All of these factors may prove to be problematic. The following chapter will cover a set of different methods potentially modelling a process, as well as how to control it.
