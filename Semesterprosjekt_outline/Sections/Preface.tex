\todo[inline]{Complete the preface}
This document is a semester-project report that was written during the autumn-semester of 2019 at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The project was done under the supervision of associate professor Jon Are Wold Suul. Throughout the semester, he provided information about electrical three-phase circuits, the w-transform, certain characteristics of the w-transform and methods for tuning SISO-systems. All data-plots in the report were made using Python 3, and all simulations of the three-phase system were done with Matlab and Simulink. The figures that are not explicitly referred to as originating from somewhere else were made in Microsoft Visio. In this project, it is assumed that the reader has some basic knowledge of electrical circuits and three-phase power, as well as at least some understanding of linear algebra and linear dynamic systems. Finally, Morten Dinhoff Pedersen helped to highlight the problem with using the trapezoidal rule for estimation, and Harald Hanche-Olsen helped with mentioning a method for how to give an upper bound to a set of matrix-multiplications.
