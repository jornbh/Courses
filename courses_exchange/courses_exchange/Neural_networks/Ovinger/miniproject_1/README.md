# Miniproject 1

The Jupyter notebook hoged all the memory on my PC and killed it. I ended up implementing everything from taks 3 and onwards in separate python files. (I did get to update the notebook with google colab, after I got to hear about it)

- Task 3-7 are implemented in the folder vanilla_python
- The awnsers are in

  - Task 1: [Task_1.md](Awnsers/Task_1.md)
  - Task 2: [Task_2.md](Awnsers/Task_2.md)
  - Task 3: [Task_3.md](Awnsers/Task_3.md)
  - Task 4: [Task_4.md](Awnsers/Task_4.md)
  - Task 5: [Task_5.md](Awnsers/Task_5.md)
  - Task 6: [Task_6.md](Awnsers/Task_6.md)
  - Task 7: [Task_7.md](Awnsers/Task_7.md)
