MODIFICATIONS:

Model:
* Add Controller subsystem.
* Move grate speed input into subsystem.
* Add a ChooseInput block in front of every process value input, so that it
  is possible to choose between, constant, experimental and controlled inputs.
* Replace the interpreted Boiler/Pressure_SP with a Simulink function block to speed up simulation.
* Put plant into separate subsystem (not important).
* Set steam signal dimension explicitly to 1. Only relevant if you get simulation errors mentioning this.

Simulation:
* Enable accelerator mode to speed up the simulation.
* Enable simulation optimizations (faster runs) to speed up the simulation.
